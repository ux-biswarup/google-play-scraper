## Step-by-Step Implementation
### 1. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install google-play-scraper pandas matplotlib seaborn openai
```

### 2. Fetch App Reviews
Use `google-play-scraper` to extract Play Store reviews.
```python
from google_play_scraper import reviews
import pandas as pd

app_reviews, _ = reviews(
    'com.example.app',
    lang='en',
    country='us',
    count=1000
)

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(app_reviews)
print(df.head())
```

### 3. Analyze Sentiment & Topics using Claude API
```python
import openai

def analyze_sentiment(review_text):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="claude-2",
        prompt=f"Analyze the sentiment and extract key topics from this review: {review_text}",
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["text"].strip()

df['analysis'] = df['content'].apply(analyze_sentiment)
print(df.head())
```

### 4. Generate Insights
Summarize key findings by aggregating sentiment scores and topic distributions.
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Visualizing Sentiment Distribution
sns.countplot(y=df['analysis'], order=df['analysis'].value_counts().index)
plt.title("Sentiment Distribution")
plt.show()
```

### 5. Present Findings
- Export insights as a report.
- Build a **Streamlit** dashboard to explore user feedback interactively.
